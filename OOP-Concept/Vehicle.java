        /*
         Reusability:
         - The Vehicle class is a reusable template.
         - We donâ€™t have to rewrite common methods (start, stop, refuel, display).
         
         Extensibility:
         - New types like Bus, EVCar, or Bicycle can extend Vehicle.
         - They can override or add behaviors without changing existing code.
         
         Benefits:
         - Less code duplication.
         - Easy maintenance.
         - Clear structure (base + specialized classes).
